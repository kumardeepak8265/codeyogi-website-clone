              Our goal is not to run hobby classNames but instead to create job
              ready candidates. So we are selective in who we train. We conduct
              a mathematical aptitude test to filter out students who have the
              raw talent needed for a successful software engineering career.
              Then we take personal interview to check if they have strong will
              needed to achieve their dreams.

              We understand how important 'people skills' are for a successful
              career. That's why soft skills coaching is an integral part of our
              curriculum. We have a continuous feedback process in place to help
              you improve and grow.

            <p className="text-gray-500">
              Selected students are trained rigorously for 6 months under the
              guidance of experienced mentors and teaching assistants. Itâ€™s not
              passive teaching; instead students build a number of apps as part
              of the curriculum. We keep our curriculum in constant sync with
              industry needs so that students are not taught anything obsolete
              in this fast moving tech world.

              conduct mock interviews and group discussions to instil confidence
              in students. Once the training is complete we help them in getting
              the right jobs by arranging interviews with our partner employers.
